# Base Operations Application
An app for basic base operations like convertions between different bases and base arithmetics. It lets you convert numbers through base 10 or using one of the other methods (substitution, succesive division, fast convertions between bases 2, 4, 8, 16). You can also add/subtract two numbers in different bases with the result in a base of your choosing.

Python 3.6

* How to convert abstract entities in code (classes)
* Deepened my understanding of base operations and convertions
* Exercesied python structures and classes
